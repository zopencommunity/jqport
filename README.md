z/OS Open Tools Sample Port for education
 
This repository provides a concrete example of porting repository packaged in
the ZOSOpenTools set of porting repositories.

If you want to add a new Open-Source tool to the ZOSOpenTools set of repositories,
this is a great place to start. We recommend you begin by 'taking the defaults'
as much as possible. This will make it easier for others to understand as they 
begin to work on the port as well. 

To get started with the ZOSOpenTools initiative in general, 
read [ZOSOpenTools docs)(https://zosopentools.github.io/meta)
